### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/UBC-GEOS472-Spring2022/antarctic_expedition_public/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
